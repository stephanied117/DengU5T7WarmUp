public class Temperature {
    // ---- test constructor ----
// 1. create a Temperature object named temp1 with a
// high of 78.52, a low of 54.59, and a scale of "F",
// then print the string returned by tempInfo()


// 2. create a Temperature object named temp2 with a
// high of 23.90, a low of 14.95, and a scale of "C",
// then print the string returned by tempInfo()




// 3. create a Temperature object named temp3 with a
// high of 57.53, a low of 38.65, and a scale of "K",
// then print the string returned by tempInfo(); the
// scale should have defaulted to "F"



// --- test public static conversion methods ---
// 4. use your static convertFtoC method to convert 78.5
//    to Celcius; print the returned result



// 5. use your static convertCtoF method to convert 12.6
//   to Fahrenheit; print the returned result




// --- test instance methods ---
// 6. change temp1 to Celcius using changeToC,
// then print the string returned by tempInfo()




// 7. try changing temp1 to Celcius again by calling
// changeToC a second time.
// then print the string returned by tempInfo() to show
// that nothing happens since it is already C



// 8. change temp1 back to Fahrenheit using changeToF,
// then print the string returned by tempInfo()




// 9. try changing temp1 to Fahrenheit again by calling
// changeToF a second time.
// then print the string returned by tempInfo() to show
// that nothing happens since it is already F
