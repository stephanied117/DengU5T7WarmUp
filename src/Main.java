        //1. Look at the code above; PREDICT the output -- then run to confirm.
        //   -> ANSWER Question a) what was the printed output?

        //2. Note how the area method and feetToInches are being called above;
        //   -> ANSWER Question b) how is calling the area instance method
        //      different from calling the feetToInches static method?

        //3. Compare the code for the area and feetToInches methods
        //   in the Rectangle class;
        //   -> ANSWER Question c) which method makes use of instance
        //      variables and which one doesn't?

        //4. Try adding the "static" keyword to the area method then running
        //   the code above again; what is the error? (now change the method
        //   back to non-static)
        //   -> ANSWER Question d) can static methods use instance variables?

        //5. Add a perimeter method to the Rectangle class that returns
        //   the perimeter of the Rectangle object as a double
        //   THEN ADD TEST CODE BELOW THAT USES THE METHOD TO OBTAIN
        //   AND PRINT THE PERIMETER OF the myRect object created above (should be 26.0)



        //6. -> ANSWER Question e) copy/paste your perimeter method and
        //      the test code you wrote above

        //7. -> ANSWER Question f) Did you write the perimeter method
        //      as an instance method or a static method? Why?
        //      If you made the method static, try making it non-static
        //      and vice versa; can it be written the other way?  Why or why not?

        //8. Add a inchesToFeet "utility" method to the Rectangle class that has
        //   a double parameter and returns that value converted to feet
        //   THEN ADD TEST CODE BELOW THAT USES THE METHOD TO OBTAIN
        //   AND PRINT 100 inches converted to feet (should be 8.333...)



        //9. -> ANSWER Question g) copy/paste your inchesToFeet method and
        //      the test code you wrote above

        //10. -> ANSWER Question h) Did you write the inchesToFeet method
        //       as an instance method or static method? Why?
        //       If you made the method static, try making it non-static
        //       and vice versa; can it be written the other way?  Why or why not?

        //11. -> ANSWER Question j) what kind of methods do you think
        //       make good candidates for instance methods and which make
        //       good candidates for static methods?

        //12. -> ANSWER Question k) inchesToFeet could have been written as
        //       a static method or instance method; in this situation,
        //       which do you think is preferred?
    }
